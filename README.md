  The coding begins in the back-end with Java entities and
  displayed with an Angular front-end, with various technologies used in between.
  Software engineering principles highlighted include Object Oriented Programming,
  Test Driven Development, Pair-Programming, Git Collaboration, and User Story
  Requirements.

  Nearly all of this program was done remotely. The entirety of this project
  was done remotely across all 4 timezones in the Continental US and emphasized
  the importance of teamwork, patience, and persistence.

### Overview

CampFree is a free application for the dispersed camping community that focuses
on crowd-sourcing created or existing campsites with no fees or reservations. While
some may opt to pay and hassle with reservations for busy campgrounds, not many
realize that there is plenty of public land available for camping which results
in a better connection with nature and a more somber camping experience.

The functionality focuses on the profile page and the main homepage with the map
and expansive list of interactive campsite data. This map and list is reliant on
crowd sourced data from its enthusiastic users.
